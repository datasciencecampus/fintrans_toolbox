# This project is x, with x purpose

- README shows the project aim and how to run
- hello_world.ipynb shows a sample code and use of packages
- install dependencies is useful if sharing the note book
- able to access GITHUB, currently cannot connect to GITLAB
- possible to run both r and python in the same notebook if needed

- this is a good starting place for users as well as the LUDA set-up document from ONS: https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/introduction
- not checked but this is probably useful to understand alongside bigquery documentation: https://cloud.google.com/architecture/data-science-with-r-on-gcp-eda

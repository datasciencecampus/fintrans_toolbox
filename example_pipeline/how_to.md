## Running the pipeline (Python only)

The entry point for the pipeline is stored within the package and called `run_pipeline.py`.
To run the pipeline, run the following code in the terminal (whilst in the root directory of the
project e.g. in this case fintrans_toolbox).

```shell / terminal
python example_pipeline/run_pipeline.py
```

Alternatively, most Python IDE's allow you to run the code directly from the IDE using a `run` button.
